# TeleTurk
* This project is driven from [TLSharp](https://github.com/sochix/TLSharp) and thanks to Sochix.
* Thanks to @XyLoNaMiyX for his amazing [CodeGenerator](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/TLSharp.CodeGenerator).

# Status
Do not try to use this project!!! It is still under development and needs a lot of things to implement!

# How To Use
1. Create a [developer account](https://my.telegram.org/) in Telegram.
2. Fill the [Configuration.cs] (https://github.com/ShanalTeam/TeleTurk/blob/master/TeleTurk.Core/Configuration.cs) with apiHash and apiID you got from developer account, you also need to put your registered phonenumber there. 

## Authentication

```csharp
var store = new FileSessionStore();                     // store session file
var client = new TelegramClient(store, "session");      // create client
await client.Connect();                                 // try to connect
var hash = await client.SendCodeRequest();              // send Code request for registerd phone number
var code = "87493";                                     // you can change code in debugger
var user = await client.MakeAuth(hash, code);           // send code and hash to get confirm from telegram
```

## Using the library
### Sending and receiving requests
This is still a work in progress. To implement a new request, open up `TelegramClient.cs` and write down your request following this scheme:
```csharp
public async Task<...> MakeRequest(...)
{
    var request = new TL.SomeRequest(...);
    return await _sender.SendReceive<...>(request);
}
```

For example, if we wanted to write a request to delete a contact we would do:
```csharp
// Returns true if the contacts were deleted
public async Task<bool> DeleteContacts(List<InputUser> inputUsers)
{
    var request = new TL.ContactsDeleteContactsRequest(inputUsers);
    return await _sender.SendReceive<bool>(request);
}
```

### Retrieving Telegram object properties
You have different ways to use the Telegram types. One is casting the `abstract` type to its real type. For example:
```csharp
// We have an abstract Message object
Message message = ...;

// We want to retrieve its Id
int id;

// We need to check against what type is before casting
if (message is TL.MessageEmptyType)
    id = ((TL.MessageType)message).Id;

else if (message is TL.MessageType)
    id = ((TL.MessageServiceType)message).Id;

else if (message is TL.MessageServiceType)
    id = ((TL.MessageServiceType)message).Id;
```

This however can quickly become annoying. You can also do:
```csharp
// Accessing the Id by using the indexer
Message message = ...;
int id = (int)message["Id"];
```

Fairly easier!
